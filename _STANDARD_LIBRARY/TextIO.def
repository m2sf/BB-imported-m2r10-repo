DEFINITION MODULE TextIO;

(* Driver for Line Oriented Text IO *)

(* This module interprets the contents of files as a sequence of lines of text
   delimited by newline. The module is implemented on top of module FileIO. *)

IMPORT FileIO;


(* Read a line of text *)

PROCEDURE ReadLine ( infile : FileIO.File; VAR str : ARRAY OF CHAR );
(* Reads a line of text from <file> and passes it back in <str>. A runtime
   error is raised if the line exceeds the capacity of <str>. *)


(* Skip a line of text *)

PROCEDURE SkipLine ( infile : FileIO.File );
(* Read and ignore all characters up to and including the first newline. *)


(* Write a line of text *)

PROCEDURE WriteLine ( outfile : FileIO.File; str : ARGLIST >0 OF ARRAY OF CHAR );
(* Writes a sequence of character strings as a line to <file>. The line is
   terminated by newline. *)


(* Write an empty line of text *)

PROCEDURE WriteLn ( outfile : FileIO.File );
(* Writes an empty line to <file>. The line is terminated by newline. *)

END TextIO.
