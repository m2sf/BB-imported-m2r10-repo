DEFINITION MODULE TzIO [ProtoIO] FOR TZ;

(* I/O Module for Type TZ *)

FROM FileIO IMPORT File;

PROCEDURE [READ] Read( infile : File; VAR n : TZ );
(* Reads the textual representation of a TZ value from stream infile
   - any leading whitespace is skipped
   - any remaining characters that are part of the numeral being read are
     removed from infile
   - the numeric value of the numeral string read is assigned to the variable
     passed in for n
   - the file status is set to any of:
     success, outOfRange, wrongFormat, endOfLine, or endOfInput. This
   procedure is substituted for invocations of READ with a TZ argument. *)

PROCEDURE [WRITE] Write( outfile : File; CONST n : TZ );
(* Writes the textual representation of value n to stream outfile. This
   procedure is substituted for invocations of WRITE with a TZ argument.*)

PROCEDURE [WRITEF] WriteF
  ( outfile      : File;
    CONST fmtStr : ARRAY OF CHAR;
    items        : ARGLIST OF CONST TZ );
(* Writes a formatted textual representation of one or more BYTE values to
   output stream outfile. The output format is determined by fmtStr. This
   procedure is substituted for invocations of WRITEF with one or more
   TZ arguments. *)

PROCEDURE [READ] ReadArray ( infile : File; VAR value : ARRAY OF TZ );
(* Calls Read repeatedly to read the textual representation of a sequence of
 TZ values from stream infile nto an array 
   - the file status is set to any of:
     success, outOfRange, wrongFormat, endOfLine, or endOfInput. This
   procedure is substituted for invocations of READ with an ARRAY OF TZ argument.*)


PROCEDURE [WRITE] WriteArray ( outfile : File; CONST value : ARRAY OF TZ );
(* Calls Write repeatedly to write an array  of TZin simple format to stream outfile.
  This procedure is substituted for invocations of WRITE with an ARRAY OF TZ argument.*)

PROCEDURE [WRITEF] WriteArrayF
  ( outfile      : File;
    CONST fmtStr : ARRAY OF CHAR;
    items        : ARGLIST OF CONST ARRAY OF TZ );
(* Writes a formatted textual representation of one or more ARRAY OF TZ values to
   output stream outfile. The output format is determined by fmtStr. This

   ARRAY OF TZ arguments. *)
