(* General Prototype Definition for Scalar and Non-Scalar Number ADTs *)

PROTOTYPE NUMBERS; (* root of numeric prototypes *)

(* Number ADTs must be opaque records to be statically allocatable,
   use of literals may be specified by more specialised prototypes *)

TYPE = OPAQUE RECORD;


(* Bindings required for Number ADTs *)

(* The operations TMIN and TMAX are meaningful only for scalar types,
   their bindings may be required by more specialised prototypes *)

(* The operations SXF and VAL are meaningful only for scalar types
   their bindings may be required by more specialised prototypes *)


(* Binding to assignment operator for non-literal values *)

PROCEDURE [:=] assign ( VAR left : NUMBERS; right : NUMBERS );


(* The operations ABS, NEG and ODD are not common to all number types,
   their bindings may be required by more specialised prototypes *)


(* Bindings to dyadic operations *)

PROCEDURE [+] add ( op1, op2 : NUMBERS ) : NUMBERS;
(* procedure to bind to the + operator for operands of the number ADT *)

PROCEDURE [-] subtract ( op1, op2 : NUMBERS ) : NUMBERS;
(* procedure to bind to the - operator for operands of the number ADT *)

(* The operations *, /, DIV and MOD are not common to all number types,
   their bindings may be required by more specialised prototypes *)


(* Bindings to relational operations *)

PROCEDURE [=] isEqual ( op1, op2 : NUMBERS ) : BOOLEAN;
(* procedure to bind to the = operator for operands of the scalar ADT *)

(* The operation for the # operator is synthesized as NOT (op1 = op2) *)

(* The operations < and > are meaningful only to scalar types,
   their bindings may be required by more specialised prototypes *)
