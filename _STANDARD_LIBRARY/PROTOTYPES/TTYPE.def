PROTOTYPE TTYPE [NONSCALAR]; (* conforms to NONSCALAR *)

(* Prototype Definition for Numeric Tuple ADTs *)


(* Tuple ADTs must be transparent records,
   structurally equivalent literals are compatible by default *)

TYPE = RECORD;


(* Bindings required for TTYPE ADTs *)

(* Via-SXF conversion between structurally equivalent non-scalar numeric types
   is synthesised using SXF and VAL conversions on their scalar components *)


(* Bindings to monadic operations *)

PROCEDURE [ABS] abs ( t : TTYPE ) : TTYPE;
(* procedure to bind to pervasive function ABS for arguments of the ADT *)

PROCEDURE [NEG] neg ( t : VTYPE ) : VTYPE;
(* procedure to bind to pervasive function NEG for arguments of the ADT *)


(* Bindings to dyadic operations *)

(* none *)


(* Bindings to relational operations *)

PROCEDURE [=] isEqual ( t1, t2 : TTYPE ) : BOOLEAN;
(* procedure to bind to the = operator for operands of the ADT *)

(* The operation for the # operator is synthesized as NOT (v1 = v2) *)


END TTYPE.
