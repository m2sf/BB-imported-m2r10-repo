PROTOTYPE ProtoVector [ProtoNonScalar]; (* conforms to ProtoNonScalar *)

(* Prototype Definition for Numeric Vector ADTs *)


(* Numeric Vector ADTs must be transparent records,
   structurally equivalent literals are compatible by default *)

TYPE = RECORD;


(* Bindings required for ProtoVector ADTs *)

(* Via-SXF conversion between structurally equivalent non-scalar numeric types
   is synthesised using SXF and VAL conversions on their scalar components *)


(* Bindings to monadic operations *)

PROCEDURE [ABS] abs ( v : ProtoVector ) : ProtoVector;
(* procedure to bind to pervasive function ABS for arguments of the ADT *)

PROCEDURE [NEG] neg ( v : ProtoVector ) : ProtoVector;
(* procedure to bind to pervasive function NEG for arguments of the ADT *)


(* Bindings to dyadic operations *)

PROCEDURE [+] plus ( v1, v2 : ProtoVector ) : ProtoVector;
(* procedure to bind to the + operator for operands of the ADT *)

PROCEDURE [-] minus ( v1, v2 : ProtoVector ) : ProtoVector;
(* procedure to bind to the - operator for operands of the ADT *)


(* Bindings to relational operations *)

PROCEDURE [=] isEqual ( v1, v2 : ProtoVector ) : BOOLEAN;
(* procedure to bind to the = operator for operands of the ADT *)

(* The operation for the # operator is synthesized as NOT (v1 = v2) *)
