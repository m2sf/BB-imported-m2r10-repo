(* Bindings required for Z-Type ADTs *)


(* Bindings for pervasive functions TMIN and TMAX *)

PROCEDURE [TMIN] minValue : ZTYPE;
(* return the value that pervasive function TMIN shall return for the ADT *)

PROCEDURE [TMAX] maxValue : ZTYPE;
(* return the value that pervasive function TMAX shall return for the ADT *)


(* Binding to assignment operator *)

PROCEDURE [:=] assign ( VAR left : ZTYPE; CONST right : ZTYPE );


(* Bindings to scalar conversion primitives *)

PROCEDURE [SXF] toSXF ( x : ZTYPE; VAR sxf : ARRAY OF CHAR );
(* conversion of a ZTYPE ADT value to scalar exchange format *)

PROCEDURE [VAL] fromSXF ( CONST sxf : ARRAY OF CHAR; VAR x : ZTYPE );
(* conversion of scalar exchange format to a ZTYPE ADT value *)


(* Bindings to monadic operations *)

PROCEDURE [ABS] abs ( x : ZTYPE ) : ZTYPE;
(* procedure to bind to pervasive function ABS for arguments of the ADT *)

PROCEDURE [NEG] neg ( x : ZTYPE ) : ZTYPE;
(* procedure to bind to pervasive function NEG for arguments of the ADT *)

(* procedure to bind to pervasive function ODD for arguments of the ADT *)


(* Bindings to dyadic operations *)

PROCEDURE [+] plus ( x1, x2 : ZTYPE ) : ZTYPE;
(* procedure to bind to the + operator for operands of the ADT *)

(* The operation for the ++ statement is synthesized as x := x + 1 *)

(* procedure to bind to the - operator for operands of the ADT *)

(* The operation for the -- statement is synthesized as x := x - 1 *)

PROCEDURE [*] multiply ( x1, x2 : ZTYPE ) : ZTYPE;
(* procedure to bind to the * operator for operands of the ADT *)

PROCEDURE [DIV] div ( x1, x2 : ZTYPE ) : ZTYPE;
(* procedure to bind to the DIV operator for operands of the ADT *)


(* Bindings to relational operations *)

PROCEDURE [=] isEqual ( x1, x2 : ZTYPE ) : BOOLEAN;
(* procedure to bind to the = operator for operands of the ADT *)

(* The operation for the # operator is synthesized as NOT (x1 = x2) *)

(* procedure to bind to the < operator for operands of the ADT *)

(* The operation for the <= operator is synthesized as NOT (x1 > x2) *)
