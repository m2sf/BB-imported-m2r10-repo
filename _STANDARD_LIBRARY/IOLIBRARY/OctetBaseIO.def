DEFINITION MODULE OctetBaseIO [ProtoIO] FOR OCTET;

(* Channel IO Extension Library for Values of Type OCTET *)

IMPORT ChanIO;

(* EBNF of the textual representation of OCTET values:
    octetValue : simpleFormat |
        base16Format | base2Format | rawBase16Format | rawBase2Format ;
    simpleFormat : base16Digit base16Digit ;
    base16Format : "0x" simpleFormat ;
    base2Format : "0b" rawBase2Format ;
    rawBase16Format : "0" simpleFormat ;
    rawBase2Format : bit bit bit bit bit bit bit bit ;
    base16Digit : "0" .. "9" | "A" .. "F" ;
    bit : "0" | "1" ; *)

PROCEDURE [READ] Read ( inchan : ChanIO.Channel; VAR n : OCTET );
(* Reads the textual representation of an OCTET value from channel inchan
   - any leading whitespace is skipped
   - any remaining characters that are part of the value being read are
     removed from inchan
   - the textual representation of the value read is assigned to n
   - the channel status is set to any of:
     success, outOfRange, wrongFormat, endOfLine, or endOfInput. This
   procedure is substituted for invocations of READ with an OCTET argument.*)

PROCEDURE [WRITE] Write ( outchan : ChanIO.Channel; n : OCTET );
(* Writes the value of OCTET n in simple format to channel outchan. This pro-
   cedure is substituted for invocations of WRITE with an OCTET argument. *)

PROCEDURE [WRITEF] WriteF
  ( outchan      : ChanIO.Channel;
    CONST fmtStr : ARRAY OF CHAR;
    items        : ARGLIST >0 OF OCTET );
(* Writes a formatted textual representation of one or more OCTET values to
   output channel outchan. The output format is determined by fmtStr. This
   procedure is substituted for invocations of WRITEF with one or more
   OCTET arguments. *)
