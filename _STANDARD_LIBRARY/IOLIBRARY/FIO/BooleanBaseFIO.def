DEFINITION MODULE BooleanBaseFIO [ProtoIO] FOR BOOLEAN;

(* File-Pointer IO Extension Library for Values of Type BOOLEAN *)

IMPORT FilePtrIO;

(* EBNF of the textual representation of BOOLEAN values:
    boolValue : trueFalseFormat | yesNoFormat ;
    trueFalseFormat : "TRUE" | "FALSE" ;
    yesNoFormat : "YES" | "NO" ; *)

PROCEDURE [READ] Read ( infile : FilePtrIO.File; VAR b : BOOLEAN );
(* Reads the textual representation of a BOOLEAN value from stream infile
   - any leading whitespace is skipped
   - any remaining characters that are part of the value being read are
     removed from infile
   - the textual representation of the value read is assigned to b
   - the file status is set to any of:
     success, outOfRange, wrongFormat, endOfLine, or endOfInput. This
   procedure is substituted for invocations of READ with a BOOLEAN argument.*)

PROCEDURE [WRITE] Write ( outfile : FilePtrIO.File; b : BOOLEAN );
(* Writes the textual representation of BOOLEAN b to stream outfile. This
   procedure is substituted for invocations of WRITE with a BOOLEAN argument.*)

PROCEDURE [WRITEF] WriteF
  ( outfile      : FilePtrIO.File;
    CONST fmtStr : ARRAY OF CHAR;
    items        : ARGLIST >0 OF BOOLEAN );
(* Writes a formatted textual representation of one or more BOOLEAN values to
   output stream outfile. The output format is determined by fmtStr. This
   procedure is substituted for invocations of WRITEF with one or more
   BOOLEAN arguments. *)
