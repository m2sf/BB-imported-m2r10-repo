The IO library has three layers:
* Channel based IO
* File-Pointer based IO
* File-Descriptor based IO

Type specific IO libraries are located in:
* subdirectory CHIO for channel based IO
* subdirectory FIO for file-pointer based IO
* subdirectory FDIO for file-descriptor based IO

Channel specific IO libraries are:
* ChanIO, provides generic channel type for channel IO
* FileIO, provides file specific channel type
* SocketIO, provides socket specific channel type

System Interface IO libraries are:
* FilePtrIO, Interface to system specific file-pointer IO
* FileDescIO, Interface to system specific file-descriptor IO
* NetSockIO, Interface to system specific network socket IO
