DEFINITION MODULE LongComplexIO [ProtoIO] FOR LONGCOMPLEX;

(* IO Extension Library for Type LONGCOMPLEX *)


PROCEDURE [READ] Read( infile : File; VAR z : LONGCOMPLEX );
(* Reads the textual representation of a LONGCOMPLEX value from stream infile
   - any leading whitespace is skipped
   - any remaining characters that are part of the numeral being read are
     removed from infile
   - the numeric value of the numeral string read is assigned to the variable
     passed in for z
   - the file status is set to any of:
     success, outOfRange, wrongFormat, endOfLine, or endOfInput. This procedure
     is substituted for invocations of READ with a LONGCOMPLEX argument. *)

PROCEDURE [WRITE] Write( outfile : File; CONST z : LONGCOMPLEX );
(* Writes the textual representation of value z to stream outfile. This pro-
   cedure is substituted for invocations of WRITE with a LONGCOMPLEX argument.*)

PROCEDURE [WRITEF] WriteF
  ( outfile      : File;
    CONST fmtStr : ARRAY OF CHAR;
    items        : VARIADIC OF LONGCOMPLEX );
(* Writes a formatted textual representation of one or more LONGCOMPLEX values
   to output stream outfile. The output format is determined by fmtStr. This
   procedure is substituted for invocations of WRITEF with one or more
   LONGCOMPLEX arguments. *)
