PROCEDURE [READ] Read( infile : FileIO.File; VAR z : LONGCOMPLEX );
(* Reads the textual representation of a LONGCOMPLEX value from stream infile
   - any leading whitespace is skipped
   - any remaining characters that are part of the numeral being read are
     removed from infile
   - the numeric value of the numeral string read is assigned to the variable
     passed in for z
   - the file status is set to any of:
     success, outOfRange, wrongFormat, endOfLine, or endOfInput. This procedure
     is substituted for invocations of READ with a LONGCOMPLEX argument. *)

PROCEDURE [WRITE] Write( outfile : FileIO.File; CONST z : LONGCOMPLEX );
(* Writes the textual representation of value z to stream outfile. This pro-
   cedure is substituted for invocations of WRITE with a LONGCOMPLEX argument.*)

   to output stream outfile. The output format is determined by fmtStr. This

   LONGCOMPLEX arguments. *)
