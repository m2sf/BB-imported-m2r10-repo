DEFINITION MODULE LongComplexIO [ProtoIO] FOR LONGCOMPLEX;

(* I/O Module for Type LONGCOMPLEX *)

FROM FileIO IMPORT File;

PROCEDURE [READ] Read( infile : File; VAR z : LONGCOMPLEX );
(* Reads the textual representation of a LONGCOMPLEX value from stream infile
   - any leading whitespace is skipped
   - any remaining characters that are part of the numeral being read are
     removed from infile
   - the numeric value of the numeral string read is assigned to the variable
     passed in for n
   - the file status is set to any of:
     success, outOfRange, wrongFormat, endOfLine, or endOfInput. This
   procedure is substituted for invocations of READ with a LONGCOMPLEX argument. *)

PROCEDURE [WRITE] Write( outfile : File; CONST z : LONGCOMPLEX );
(* Writes the textual representation of value n to stream outfile. This
   procedure is substituted for invocations of WRITE with a LONGCOMPLEX argument.*)

PROCEDURE [WRITEF] WriteF

    CONST fmtStr : ARRAY OF CHAR;
    items        : ARGLIST OF CONST LONGCOMPLEX );
(* Writes a formatted textual representation of one or more BYTE values to
   output stream outfile. The output format is determined by fmtStr. This
   procedure is substituted for invocations of WRITEF with one or more
   LONGCOMPLEX arguments. *)

PROCEDURE [READ] ReadArray ( infile : File; VAR value : ARRAY OF LONGCOMPLEX );
(* Calls Read repeatedly to read the textual representation of a sequence of
 LONGCOMPLEX values from stream infile into an array.
   - the file status is set to any of:
     success, outOfRange, wrongFormat, endOfLine, or endOfInput. This
   procedure is substituted for invocations of READ with an ARRAY OF LONGCOMPLEX argument.*)

PROCEDURE [WRITE] WriteArray ( outfile : File; CONST value : ARRAY OF LONGCOMPLEX );
(* Calls Write repeatedly to write an array  of LONGCOMPLEXin simple format to stream outfile.
  This procedure is substituted for invocations of WRITE with an ARRAY OF LONGCOMPLEX argument.*)

PROCEDURE [WRITEF] WriteArrayF
  ( outfile      : File;
    CONST fmtStr : ARRAY OF CHAR;
    items        : ARGLIST OF CONST ARRAY OF LONGCOMPLEX );
(* Writes a formatted textual representation of one or more ARRAY OF LONGCOMPLEX values to
   output stream outfile. The output format is determined by fmtStr. This

   ARRAY OF LONGCOMPLEX arguments. *)
