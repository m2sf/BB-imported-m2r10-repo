PROCEDURE [READ] Read( infile : File; VAR n : STRING );
(* Reads the textual representation of a STRING value from stream infile
   - any leading whitespace is skipped
   - any remaining characters that are part of the string being read are
     removed from infile
   - the textual representation of the string read is assigned to the variable
     passed in for s
   - the file status is set to any of:
     success, outOfRange, wrongFormat, endOfLine, or endOfInput. This
   procedure is substituted for invocations of READ with a STRING argument. *)

PROCEDURE [WRITE] Write( outfile : File; CONST n : STRING );
(* Writes the textual representation of value n to stream outfile. This
   procedure is substituted for invocations of WRITE with a STRING argument.*)

PROCEDURE [WRITEF] WriteF

    CONST fmtStr : ARRAY OF CHAR;
    items        : ARGLIST OF CONST STRING );
(* Writes a formatted textual representation of one or more BYTE values to
   output stream outfile. The output format is determined by fmtStr. This
   procedure is substituted for invocations of WRITEF with one or more
   STRING arguments. *)

PROCEDURE [READ] ReadArray ( infile : File; VAR value : ARRAY OF STRING );
(* Calls Read repeatedly to read the textual representation of a sequence of
 STRING values from stream infile into an array.
   - the file status is set to any of:
     success, outOfRange, wrongFormat, endOfLine, or endOfInput. This
   procedure is substituted for invocations of READ with an ARRAY OF STRING argument.*)


PROCEDURE [WRITE] WriteArray ( outfile : File; CONST value : ARRAY OF STRING );
(* Calls Write repeatedly to write an array  of STRINGin simple format to stream outfile.
  This procedure is substituted for invocations of WRITE with an ARRAY OF STRING argument.*)

PROCEDURE [WRITEF] WriteArrayF
  ( outfile      : File;
    CONST fmtStr : ARRAY OF CHAR;
    items        : ARGLIST OF CONST ARRAY OF STRING );

(* Writes a formatted textual representation of one or more ARRAY OF STRING values to
