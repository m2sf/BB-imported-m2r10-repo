PROCEDURE [READ] Read( infile : File; VAR d : DateTime );
(* Reads the textual representation of a Time value from stream infile
   - any leading whitespace is skipped
   - any remaining characters that are part of the numeral being read are
     removed from infile
   - the numeric value of the numeral string read is assigned to the variable
     passed in for d
   - the file status is set to any of:
     success, outOfRange, wrongFormat, endOfLine, or endOfInput.
     This procedure is substituted for invocations of READ with a
     DateTime argument. *)
