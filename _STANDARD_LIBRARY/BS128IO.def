DEFINITION MODULE BS128IO [ProtoIO] FOR BS128;

(* I/O Module for Type BS128 *)

FROM FileIO IMPORT File;

(* The EBNF for the textual representation of BS128 values is:
    bitsetValue : simpleFormat | compactFormat | bitGroupFormat ;
    simpleFormat : bit+ ;
    compactFormat : base16Digit+ ;
    bitGroupFormat : "{" bit+ ( groupSeparator? bit+ )* "}" ;
    groupSeparator : " " | "." ;
    bit  : "0" | "1" ;
    base16Digit : "0" .. "9" | "A" .. "F" ;
   The number of bits shown is equal to the bitwidth of the BS128 type. *)


PROCEDURE [READ] Read ( infile : File; VAR bitset : BS128 );
(* Reads the textual representation of a BS128 value from stream infile
   - any leading whitespace is skipped
   - any remaining characters that are part of the value being read are
     removed from infile
   - the textual representation of the value read is assigned to set
   - the file status is set to any of:
     success, outOfRange, wrongFormat, endOfLine, or endOfInput. This
   procedure is substituted for invocations of READ with a BS128 argument. *)

PROCEDURE [WRITE] ( outfile : File; CONST bitset : BS128 );
(* Writes the value of BS128 bitset in simple format to stream outfile. This
   procedure is substituted for invocations of WRITE with a BS128 argument.*)

PROCEDURE [WRITEF] WriteF
  ( outfile      : File;
    CONST fmtStr : ARRAY OF CHAR;
    items        : ARGLIST OF CONST BS128 );
(* Writes a formatted textual representation of one or more BS128 values to
   output stream outfile. The output format is determined by fmtStr. This
   procedure is substituted for invocations of WRITEF with one or more
   BS128 arguments. *)

   (* for arrays of the type *)

PROCEDURE [READ] ReadArray ( infile : File; VAR value : ARRAY OF BS128 );
(* Calls Read repeatedly to read the textual representation of a sequence of
 BS128 values from stream infile into an array.
   - the file status is set to any of:
     success, outOfRange, wrongFormat, endOfLine, or endOfInput. This
   procedure is substituted for invocations of READ with an ARRAY OF BS128 argument.*)


PROCEDURE [WRITE] WriteArray ( outfile : File; CONST value : ARRAY OF BS128 );
(* Calls Write repeatedly to write an array  of BS128in simple format to stream outfile.
  This procedure is substituted for invocations of WRITE with an ARRAY OF BS128 argument.*)

PROCEDURE [WRITEF] WriteArrayF
  ( outfile      : File;
    CONST fmtStr : ARRAY OF CHAR;
    items        : ARGLIST OF CONST ARRAY OF BS128 );

(* Writes a formatted textual representation of one or more ARRAY OF BS128 values to
   output stream outfile. The output format is determined by fmtStr. This
   procedure is substituted for invocations of WRITEF with one or more
   ARRAY OF BS128 arguments. *)
