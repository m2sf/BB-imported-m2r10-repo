DEFINITION MODULE CARDINALIO [ProtoInteger] FOR CARDINAL;

(* IO Extension Library for Type CARDINAL *)

FROM FileIO IMPORT File;

(* EBNF of the textual representation of CARDINAL values:
    cardinalValue : simpleFormat |
        base16Format | rawBase16Format | universalFormat ;
    simpleFormat : decimalDigit+ ;
    base16Format : "0x" base16Digit+ ;
    rawBase16Format : "0" base16Digit+ ;
    universalFormat :  sign? fillChar* numeral ;
    sign : "+" ;
    fillChar : " " | "*" | "0" ;
    numeral : leadDigitGroup ( separator? digitGroup )* ;
    separator : " " | "'" | "." | "," ;
    leadDigitGroup : decimalDigit decimalDigit? decimalDigit? ;
    digitGroup : decimalDigit decimalDigit decimalDigit ;
    decimalDigit  : "0" .. "9" ;
    base16Digit : decimalDigit | "A" .. "F" ; *)

PROCEDURE [READ] Read ( infile : File; VAR n : CARDINAL );
(* Reads the textual representation of a CARDINAL value from stream infile
   - any leading whitespace is skipped
   - any remaining characters that are part of the value being read are
     removed from infile
   - the textual representation of the value read is assigned to n
   - the file status is set to any of:
     success, outOfRange, wrongFormat, endOfLine, or endOfInput. This
   procedure is substituted for invocations of READ with a CARDINAL argument.*)

PROCEDURE [WRITE] Write ( outfile : File; n : CARDINAL );
(* Writes the value of CARDINAL n in simple format to stream outfile. This pro-
   cedure is substituted for invocations of WRITE with a CARDINAL argument. *)

PROCEDURE [WRITEF] WriteF
  ( outfile      : File;
    CONST fmtStr : ARRAY OF CHAR;
    items        : ARGLIST OF CARDINAL );
(* Writes a formatted textual representation of one or more CARDINAL values to
   output stream outfile. The output format is determined by fmtStr. This
   procedure is substituted for invocations of WRITEF with one or more
   CARDINAL arguments. *)
