DEFINITION MODULE ARRAYOFUNICHAR;

(* I/O, Concatenation and Slicing for ARRAY OF UNICHAR Types *)

FROM FileIO IMPORT File;

PROCEDURE Concat ( VAR result : ARRAY OF UNICHAR;
                       items  : VARIADIC OF ARRAY OF UNICHAR );
(* Concatenates  two or more ARRAY OF UNICHAR values  passed in for items  in
   the order they appear in the argument list  and passes back  the resulting
   ARRAY OF UNICHAR in result.  If  only a single argument  is passed in  for
   items, the argument is passed back verbatim in result.  String terminators
   in between concatenation items  are removed.  A final string terminator is
   appended to the end of the result.  The capacity of the variable passed in
   for result must be sufficient to hold the result including string termina-
   tor.  If it is  not sufficient, runtime fault StringCapacityExceeded shall
   be raised.  This procedure  is substituted  for invocations of CONCAT when
   CONCAT's first argument is a variable of an ARRAY OF UNICHAR type. *)

PROCEDURE CopySlice
  ( VAR   target : ARRAY OF CHAR; tgtStartIndex, tgtEndIndex : INTEGER;
    CONST source : ARRAY OF CHAR; srcStartIndex, srcEndIndex : INTEGER );
(* Copies characters  from source,  starting at srcStartIndex  and  ending at
   srcEndIndex  into target  at tgtStartIndex  but not exceeding tgtEndIndex.
   Positive indices count forward starting with zero indicating the left most
   character.  Negative indices  count backward  starting with -1  indicating
   the right most character.  If the target indices denote the entire target,
   a string terminator  is written  after the last character copied,  thereby
   effectively overwriting all the target's contents  even if the copied sub-
   string is shorter than the target.  If the target's start index is further
   right than its end index,  the copying order into the target slice  is re-
   versed.  If the source's start index is further right  than its end index,
   the copying order  from the source slice is reversed.  If the source slice
   is longer than the target slice,  only those characters that will fit into
   the target slice are copied.  If the source slice is shorter than the tar-
   get slice,  only the available characters of the source slice  are copied.
   If  any index  is out of bounds  of the  associated string,  runtime fault
   indexOutOfBounds shall be raised. *)

PROCEDURE Read ( infile : File; VAR s : ARRAY OF UNICHAR );
(* Reads a string value from stream infile
   - any leading whitespace is skipped
   - the character being read is removed from infile
   - the code point of the character value read is assigned to s
   - the file status is set to any of:
     success, outOfRange, wrongFormat, endOfLine, or endOfInput.
   This procedure is substituted for invocations of READ with an
   ARRAY OF UNICHAR type argument. *)

PROCEDURE Write ( outfile : File; CONST s : ARRAY OF UNICHAR );
(* Writes string s to stream outfile. This procedure is substituted
   for invocations of WRITE with an ARRAY OF UNICHAR type argument.*)

PROCEDURE WriteF ( outfile      : File;
                   CONST fmtStr : ARRAY OF CHAR;
                   items        : VARIADIC OF ARRAY OF UNICHAR );
(* Writes a formatted textual representation of one or more ARRAY OF UNICHAR
   values to output stream outfile. The output format is determined by fmtStr.
   This procedure is substituted for invocations of WRITEF with one or more
   ARRAY OF UNICHAR arguments. *)
