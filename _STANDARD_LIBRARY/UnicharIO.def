DEFINITION MODULE UnicharIO [ProtoIO] FOR UNICHAR;

(* I/O Module for Type UNICHAR *) 

FROM FileIO IMPORT File;

PROCEDURE [READ] Read ( infile : File; VAR ch : UNICHAR );
(* Reads a UNICHAR value from stream infile
   - any leading whitespace is skipped
   - the character being read is removed from infile
   - the code point of the character value read is assigned to ch
   - the file status is set to any of:
     success, outOfRange, wrongFormat, endOfLine, or endOfInput. This
   procedure is substituted for invocations of READ with a UNICHAR argument. *)

PROCEDURE [WRITE] Write ( outfile : File; CONST ch : UNICHAR );
(* Writes the textual representation of UNICHAR ch to stream outfile. This
   procedure is substituted for invocations of WRITE with a UNICHAR argument.*)

PROCEDURE [WRITEF] WriteF
  ( outfile      : File;
    CONST fmtStr : ARRAY OF UNICHAR;
    items        : ARGLIST OF CONST UNICHAR );
(* Writes a formatted textual representation of one or more UNICHAR values to
   output stream outfile. The output format is determined by fmtStr. This
   procedure is substituted for invocations of WRITEF with one or more
   UNICHAR arguments. *)

PROCEDURE [READ] ReadArray ( infile : File; VAR value : ARRAY OF UNICHAR );
(* Calls Read repeatedly to read the textual representation of a sequence of
 UNICHAR values from stream infile nto an array 
   - the file status is set to any of:
     success, outOfRange, wrongFormat, endOfLine, or endOfInput. This
   procedure is substituted for invocations of READ with an ARRAY OF UNICHAR argument.*)


PROCEDURE [WRITE] WriteArray ( outfile : File; CONST value : ARRAY OF UNICHAR );
(* Calls Write repeatedly to write an array  of UNICHARin simple format to stream outfile.
  This procedure is substituted for invocations of WRITE with an ARRAY OF UNICHAR argument.*)

PROCEDURE [WRITEF] WriteArrayF
  ( outfile      : File;
    CONST fmtStr : ARRAY OF UNICHAR;
    : ARGLIST OF CONST UNICHAR );

(* Writes a formatted textual representation of one or more ARRAY OF UNICHAR values to
   output stream outfile. The output format is determined by fmtStr. This
   procedure is substituted for invocations of WRITEF with one or more
   ARRAY OF UNICHAR arguments. *)
