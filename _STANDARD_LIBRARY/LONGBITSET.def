DEFINITION MODULE LONGBITSET;

(* I/O Module for Type LONGBITSET *)

FROM FileIO IMPORT File;

(* The EBNF for the textual representation of LONGBITSET values is:
    bitsetValue : simpleFormat | compactFormat | bitGroupFormat ;
    simpleFormat : bit+ ;
    compactFormat : base16Digit+ ;
    bitGroupFormat : "{" bit+ ( groupSeparator? bit+ )* "}" ;
    groupSeparator : " " | "." ;
    bit  : "0" | "1" ;
    base16Digit : "0" .. "9" | "A" .. "F" ;
   The number of bits shown is equal to the bitwidth of the LONGBITSET type. *)

PROCEDURE Read ( infile : File; VAR set : LONGBITSET );
(* Reads the textual representation of a LONGBITSET value from stream infile
   - any leading whitespace is skipped
   - any remaining characters that are part of the value being read are
     removed from infile
   - the textual representation of the value read is assigned to set
   - the file status is set to any of:
     success, outOfRange, wrongFormat, endOfLine, or endOfInput. This
   procedure is substituted for invocations of READ with a LONGBITSET
   argument. *)

PROCEDURE Write ( outfile : File; CONST set : LONGBITSET );
(* Writes the value of LONGBITSET set in simple format to stream outfile. This
   procedure is substituted for invocations of WRITE with a LONGBITSET
   argument. *)

PROCEDURE WriteF ( outfile      : File;
                   CONST fmtStr : ARRAY OF CHAR;
                   items        : VARIADIC OF LONGBITSET );
(* Writes a formatted textual representation of one or more LONGBITSET values
   to output stream outfile. The output format is determined by fmtStr. This
   procedure is substituted for invocations of WRITEF with one or more
   LONGBITSET arguments. *)

END LONGBITSET.
