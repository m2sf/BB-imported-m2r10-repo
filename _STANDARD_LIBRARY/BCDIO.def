DEFINITION MODULE BCDIO [ProtoIO] FOR BCD;

(* IO Extension Library for Type BCD *)


(* Bindings required by blueprint ProtoIO *)


PROCEDURE [READ] Read( infile : File; VAR b : BCD );
(* Reads the textual representation of a BCD value from input stream infile
   - any leading whitespace is skipped
   - any remaining characters that are part of the numeral being read are
     removed from infile
   - the numeric value of the numeral string read is assigned to the variable
     passed in for b
   - the file status is set to any of:
     success, outOfRange, wrongFormat, endOfLine, or endOfInput. This
     procedure is substituted for invocations of READ with a BCD argument. *)

PROCEDURE [WRITE] Write( outfile : File; CONST b : BCD );
(* Writes the textual representation of value b to output stream outfile. This
   procedure is substituted for invocations of WRITE with a BCD argument. *)

PROCEDURE [WRITEF] WriteF
  ( outfile      : File;
    CONST fmtStr : ARRAY OF CHAR;
    items        : VARIADIC OF BCD );
(* Writes a formatted textual representation of one or more BCD values to
   output stream outfile. The output format is determined by fmtStr. This
   procedure is substituted for invocations of WRITEF with one or more
   BCD arguments. *)
