(* The operations TMIN and TMAX are not meaningful for non-scalar types *)


(* Bindings to monadic operations *)

(* The operation is not common to all non-scalar types,

(* The operations ABS and ODD are not meaningful for non-scalar types *)


(* Bindings to dyadic operations *)

(* The operation for the # operator is synthesized as NOT (op1 = op2) *)
