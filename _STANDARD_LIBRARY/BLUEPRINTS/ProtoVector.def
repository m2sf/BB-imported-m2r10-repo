(* Numeric Vector ADTs must be transparent records,
   structurally equivalent literals are compatible by default *)

(* Bindings required for ProtoVector ADTs *)

(* Via-SXF conversion between structurally equivalent non-scalar numeric types
   is synthesised using SXF and VAL conversions on their scalar components *)


(* Bindings to monadic operations *)


PROCEDURE [NEG] neg ( v : ProtoVector ) : ProtoVector;

(* Bindings to dyadic operations *)

PROCEDURE [+] plus ( v1, v2 : ProtoVector ) : ProtoVector;
(* procedure to bind to the + operator for operands of the ADT *)
