BLUEPRINT ProtoComplex [ProtoNonScalar]; (* conforms to ProtoNonScalar *)

(* Complex Number ADTs must be transparent records,
   have two fields compatible with real number literals,
   structurally equivalent literals are compatible by default *)

(* Bindings required for ProtoComplex ADTs *)

(* Via-SXF conversion between structurally equivalent non-scalar numeric types
   is synthesised using SXF and VAL conversions on their scalar components *)


(* Bindings to monadic operations *)

PROCEDURE [NEG] neg ( z : ProtoComplex ) : ProtoComplex;

(* Bindings to dyadic operations *)
