(* Blueprint for Complex Number ADTs *)

BLUEPRINT ProtoComplex [ProtoNonScalar]; (* conforms to ProtoNonScalar *)

(* Complex Number ADTs must be transparent records,
   have two fields compatible with real number literals. *)

MODULE TYPE = RECORD;

LITERAL = { REAL, REAL };


(* Bindings required for ProtoComplex ADTs *)

(* Required Constants *)

CONST [TSIGNED] isSigned = TRUE;
(* Complex ADTs are always signed. *)


(* Required Procedures *)

(* Numeric Conversion *)

(* Via-SXF conversion between structurally equivalent non-scalar numeric types
   is synthesised using SXF and VAL conversions on their scalar components *)


(* Bindings to monadic operations *)

PROCEDURE [+/-] neg ( z : ProtoComplex ) : ProtoComplex;
(* Required function to return the sign reversed value of a complex number. *)


(* Bindings to dyadic operations *)

PROCEDURE [+] plus ( z1, z2 : ProtoComplex ) : ProtoComplex;
(* procedure to bind to the + operator for operands of the ADT *)

PROCEDURE [-] minus ( z1, z2 : ProtoComplex ) : ProtoComplex;
(* procedure to bind to the - operator for operands of the ADT *)

PROCEDURE [*] multiply ( z1, z2 : ProtoComplex ) : ProtoComplex;
(* procedure to bind to the * operator for operands of the ADT *)

PROCEDURE [/] divide ( z1, z2 : ProtoComplex ) : ProtoComplex;
(* procedure to bind to the / operator for operands of the ADT *)


(* Bindings to relational operations *)

PROCEDURE [=] isEqual ( z1, z2 : ProtoComplex ) : BOOLEAN;
(* procedure to bind to the = operator for operands of the ADT *)

(* The operation for the # operator is synthesized as NOT (z1 = z2) *)
