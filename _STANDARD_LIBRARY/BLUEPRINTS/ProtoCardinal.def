(* Specialised Blueprint for Cardinal ADTs *)

BLUEPRINT ProtoCardinal [ProtoNumeric]; (* conforms to ProtoNumeric *)


(* Required Module Type *)

MODULE TYPE = RECORD := INTEGER | REAL;
(* Cardinal ADTs must be records to be statically allocatable,
   integer literals are compatible. *)


(* Required Constants *)


CONST [TSIGNED] isSigned = FALSE;
(* Cardinal ADTs are always signed. *)

CONST [TBASE] base : CARDINAL;
(* Radix in which the ADT's values are encoded, 2 or 10. *)

CONST [TPRECISION] precision : [1..4000] OF CARDINAL;
(* Maximum number of digits the ADT can encode. *)

CONST [TMINEXP] eMin = 0;
(* Cardinal ADTs always have an exponent of zero *)

CONST [TMAXEXP] eMax = 0;
(* Cardinal ADTs always have an exponent of zero *)

CONST * isWholeNumberADT = TRUE;
(* Internal flag indicating that the ADT represents whole numbers. *)


(* Required Procedures *)


(* Introspection *)

(* Binding to Predefined Function TMIN *)

PROCEDURE [TMIN] minValue : ProtoCardinal;
(* Required function to return the minimal value the ADT can encode. *)

(* An expression of the form TMIN(CardinalADT)
   is synthesised as CardinalADT.minValue(). *)


(* Binding to Predefined Function TMAX *)

PROCEDURE [TMAX] maxValue : ProtoCardinal;
(* Required function to return the maximal value the ADT can encode. *)

(* An expression of the form TMAX(CardinalADT)
   is synthesised as CardinalADT.maxValue(). *)


(* Numeric Conversion *)

(* Binding to scalar conversion primitives SXF and VAL *)

PROCEDURE [SXF] toSXF ( value : ProtoCardinal; VAR sxf : ARRAY OF OCTET );
(* Required procedure to convert a cardinal value to scalar exchange format. *)

PROCEDURE [VAL] fromSXF ( sxf : ARRAY OF OCTET; VAR value : ProtoCardinal );
(* Required procedure to convert from scalar exchange format to the ADT. *)

(* Conversion between any two scalar ADTs can be synthesised utilising the
   ADTs' conversion procedures bound to SXF and VAL.
   
   A conversion expression of the form
     intValue :: CardinalADT
   is synthesised as
     IntegerADT.toSXF(intValue, temp);
     CardinalADT.fromSXF(temp, result);
   when no direct conversion is implemented. *)


(* Literal Assignment *)

(* Numeric literals are converted to scalar exchange format at compile time.
   Assignments of numeric literals to numeric ADTs are then synthesised
   utilising an ADT's conversion procedure bound to VAL.
   
   An assignment of the form
     n := 123;
   is synthesised as
     CardinalADT.fromSXF(sxfCompiletimeValue, n); *)


(* Iteration *)

(* Binding to FOR IN iterator *)

(* Scalar ADTs may not bind any procedure to FOR.
   
   Instead, iteration over scalar ADTs and subranges of Scalar ADTs is auto-
   matically supported if and only if all of the following conditions are met:
   
   (1) the ADT binds a constant value of zero to both TMINEXP and TMAXEXP,
   (2) the ADT provides bindings for TMIN and TMAX,
   (3) the ADT provides bindings for + and -,
   (4) the ADT provides bindings for < and >.
   
   A statement of the form
     FOR n IN CardinalADT DO ...
   is equivalent to
     FOR n IN [lower .. upper] OF CardinalADT DO ...
   where lower = TMIN(CardinalADT) and upper = TMAX(CardinalADT).
     
   A statement of the form
     FOR n IN [lower .. upper] OF CardinalADT DO statementSeq END
   is synthesised as
     VAR n : CardinalADT;
     n := lower;
     LOOP
       statementSeq;
       IF n < upper THEN n++ ELSE EXIT END
     END;
   
   A statement of the form
     FOR DESCENDING n IN CardinalADT DO ...
   is equivalent to
     FOR DESCENDING n IN [lower .. upper] OF CardinalADT DO ...
   where lower = TMIN(CardinalADT) and upper = TMAX(CardinalADT).

   A statement of the form
     FOR DESCENDING n IN [lower .. upper] OF CardinalADT DO statementSeq END
   is synthesised as
     VAR n : CardinalADT;
     n := upper;
     LOOP
       statementSeq;
       IF n > lower THEN n-- ELSE EXIT END
     END; *)
