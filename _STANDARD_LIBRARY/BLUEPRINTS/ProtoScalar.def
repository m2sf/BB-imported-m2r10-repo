(* General Blueprint for Scalar ADTs *)


(* Required Module Type *)

MODULE TYPE = RECORD;
(* All scalar ADTs shall be statically allocatable. *)

(* Scalar ADTs are either compatible with whole or real number literals. *)


(* Required Constants *)

(* Scalar Properties *)

CONST [TBASE] base : CARDINAL; (* either 2 or 10. *)
(* Scalar ADTs shall define the radix in which values are encoded. *) 

CONST [TPRECISION] precision : CARDINAL; (* 1 to 4000 *)
(* Scalar ADTs shall define the maximum number of encodable digits. *)

isCountable ->
CONST [TMINEXP] eMin = 0;
(* Countable scalar ADTs shall define eMin with a value of zero. *)

NOT isCountable ->
CONST [TMINEXP] eMin : INTEGER;
(* Uncountable scalar ADTs shall define the smallest encodable exponent. *)
