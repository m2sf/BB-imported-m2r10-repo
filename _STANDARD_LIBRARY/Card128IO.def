DEFINITION MODULE Card128IO [ProtoIO] FOR CARD128;

(* I/O Module for Type CARD128 *)

FROM FileIO IMPORT File;

(* EBNF of the textual representation of CARD128 values:
    CARD128Value : simpleFormat |
        cBase16Format | m2Base16Format | universalFormat ;
    simpleFormat : decimalDigit+ ;
    cBase16Format : "0x" base16Digit+ ;
    m2Base16Format : "0" base16Digit+ "H" ;
    universalFormat :  sign? fillChar* numeral ;
    sign : "+" ;

PROCEDURE [READ] Read( infile : File; VAR n : CARD128 );
(* Reads the textual representation of a CARD128 value from stream infile
   - any leading whitespace is skipped
   - any remaining characters that are part of the numeral being read are
     removed from infile
   - the numeric value of the numeral string read is assigned to the variable
     passed in for n
   - the file status is set to any of:
     success, outOfRange, wrongFormat, endOfLine, or endOfInput. This
   procedure is substituted for invocations of READ with a CARD128 argument. *)

PROCEDURE [WRITE] Write( outfile : File; CONST n : CARD128 );
(* Writes the textual representation of value n to stream outfile. This
   procedure is substituted for invocations of WRITE with a CARD128 argument.*)

PROCEDURE [WRITEF] WriteF
  ( outfile      : File;
    CONST fmtStr : ARRAY OF CHAR;
    items        : ARGLIST OF CONST CARD128 );
(* Writes a formatted textual representation of one or more BYTE values to
   output stream outfile. The output format is determined by fmtStr. This
   procedure is substituted for invocations of WRITEF with one or more
   CARD128 arguments. *)

PROCEDURE [READ] ReadArray ( infile : File; VAR value : ARRAY OF CARD128 );
(* Calls Read repeatedly to read the textual representation of a sequence of
 CARD128 values from stream infile into an array.
   - the file status is set to any of:
     success, outOfRange, wrongFormat, endOfLine, or endOfInput. This
   procedure is substituted for invocations of READ with an ARRAY OF CARD128 argument.*)


PROCEDURE [WRITE] WriteArray ( outfile : File; CONST value : ARRAY OF CARD128 );
(* Calls Write repeatedly to write an array  of CARD128in simple format to stream outfile.
  This procedure is substituted for invocations of WRITE with an ARRAY OF CARD128 argument.*)

PROCEDURE [WRITEF] WriteArrayF
  ( outfile      : File;
    CONST fmtStr : ARRAY OF CHAR;
    items        : ARGLIST OF CONST ARRAY OF CARD128 );
(* Writes a formatted textual representation of one or more ARRAY OF CARD128 values to
   output stream outfile. The output format is determined by fmtStr. This
   procedure is substituted for invocations of WRITEF with one or more
   ARRAY OF CARD128 arguments. *)
