DEFINITION MODULE COMPLEX [ProtoComplex];

(* Single Precision Complex Numbers *) 


FROM FileIO IMPORT File; (* required for IO *)


(* COMPLEX type *)

TYPE
    COMPLEX = RECORD
        re, im : REAL;
    END; (* COMPLEX *)


(* Bindings required by blueprint ProtoComplex *)

(* Monadic arithmetic operations *) 

PROCEDURE [NEG] neg ( z : COMPLEX ) : COMPLEX;
(* Returns the sign reversed value of COMPLEX value z.
   This function is bound to the unary minus operator for type COMPLEX. *)


(* Dyadic arithmetic operations *) 

PROCEDURE [+] add ( z1, z2 : COMPLEX ) : COMPLEX;
(* Adds COMPLEX values z1 and z2 and returns the result.
   This function is bound to the + operator for type COMPLEX. *)

PROCEDURE [-] sub ( z1, z2 : COMPLEX ) : COMPLEX;
(* Subtracts COMPLEX value z2 from z1 and returns the result.
   This function is bound to the - operator for type COMPLEX. *)

PROCEDURE [*] multiply ( z1, z2 : COMPLEX ) : COMPLEX;
(* Multiplies COMPLEX values z1 and z2 and returns the result.
   This function it bound to the * operator for type COMPLEX. *)

PROCEDURE [/] divide ( z1, z2 : COMPLEX ) : COMPLEX;
(* Divives COMPLEX value z1 by z2 and returns the result.
   This function is bound to the / operator for type COMPLEX. *)


(* Relational operations *) 

PROCEDURE [=] isEqual ( z1, z2 : COMPLEX ) : BOOLEAN;
(* Returns TRUE if COMPLEX values z1 and z2 are equal, otherwise FALSE.
   This function is bound to operators = and # for type COMPLEX. *)


(* IO operations *)

PROCEDURE [READ] Read( infile : File; VAR z : COMPLEX );
(* Reads the textual representation of a COMPLEX value from input stream infile
   - any leading whitespace is skipped
   - any remaining characters that are part of the numeral being read are
     removed from infile
   - the numeric value of the numeral string read is assigned to the variable
     passed in for z
   - the file status is set to any of:
     success, outOfRange, wrongFormat, endOfLine, or endOfInput. This
   procedure is substituted for invocations of READ with a COMPLEX argument. *)

PROCEDURE [WRITE] Write( outfile : File; CONST z : COMPLEX );
(* Writes the textual representation of value z to output stream outfile. This
   procedure is substituted for invocations of WRITE with a COMPLEX argument.*)

PROCEDURE [WRITEF] WriteF
  ( outfile      : File;
    CONST fmtStr : ARRAY OF CHAR;
    items        : VARIADIC OF COMPLEX );
(* Writes a formatted textual representation of one or more COMPLEX values to
   output stream outfile. The output format is determined by fmtStr. This
   procedure is substituted for invocations of WRITEF with one or more
   COMPLEX arguments. *)

END COMPLEX.
