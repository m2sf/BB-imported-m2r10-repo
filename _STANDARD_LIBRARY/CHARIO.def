DEFINITION MODULE CharIO [ProtoIO] FOR CHAR;

(* IO Extension Library for Type CHAR *)

FROM FileIO IMPORT File;

(* EBNF of the textual representation of CHAR values:
    charValue : textFormat | numericFormat ;
    textFormat : letter | digit | nonAlphaChar ;
    numericFormat : "0u" base16Digit base16Digit ;
    base16Digit : "0" .. "9" | "A" .. "F" ; *)

PROCEDURE [READ] Read ( infile : File; VAR ch : CHAR );
(* Reads a CHAR value from stream infile
   - any leading whitespace is skipped
   - the character being read is removed from infile
   - the code point of the character value read is assigned to ch
   - the file status is set to any of:
     success, outOfRange, wrongFormat, endOfLine, or endOfInput. This
   procedure is substituted for invocations of READ with a CHAR argument. *)

PROCEDURE [WRITE] Write ( outfile : File; ch : CHAR );
(* Writes the textual representation of CHAR ch to stream outfile. This
   procedure is substituted for invocations of WRITE with a CHAR argument.*)

PROCEDURE [WRITEF] WriteF
  ( outfile      : File;
    CONST fmtStr : ARRAY OF CHAR;
    items        : ARGLIST OF CHAR );
(* Writes a formatted textual representation of one or more CHAR values to
   output stream outfile. The output format is determined by fmtStr. This
   procedure is substituted for invocations of WRITEF with one or more
   CHAR arguments. *)
