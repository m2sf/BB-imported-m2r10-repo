(* Contract Definition for Statically Allocatable Array ADTs *)

CONTRACT ProtoStaticArray [ProtoCollection];

(* Static Array ADTs must be opaque records to be statically allocatable,
   array literals are compatible *)

PLACEHOLDERS IndexType, ValueType, ProcType;

(* Bindings required for Static Array ADTs *)

(* Capacity limit *)

(* Binding to pervasive function TLIMIT *)

PROCEDURE [TLIMIT] capacityLimit : LONGCARD;
(* Procedure to return the index/value pair limit of a Static Array ADT. *)

(* An expression of the form TLIMIT(ArrayADT))
   is synthesised as ArrayADT.capacityLimit() *)


(* Binding to assignment operator *)

PROCEDURE [:=] assign ( VAR array : ProtoStaticArray;
                        valueList : VARIADIC OF ValueType );

(* Procedure to assign a structured literal to a Static Array ADT variable. *)

(* A statement of the form array := { value1, value2, ..., valueN }
   is synthesised as assign( array, value1, value2, ..., valueN ) *)


(* Storage and retrieval *)

(* Binding to [ ] notation within left hand entities *)

PROCEDURE [!] storeValue ( VAR array : ProtoStaticArray;

(* Procedure to store a value at a given index in a Static Array ADT
   variable. *)

(* A statement of the form array[index] := value
   is synthesised as storeValue( array, index, value) *)


(* Binding to [ ] notation within expressions *)

PROCEDURE [?] valueAtIndex ( array : ProtoStaticArray;
                             index : IndexType ) : ValueType;
(* Procedure to return the value stored at a given index in a Static Array
   ADT value. *)

(* An expression of the form array[index]
   is synthesised as valueAtIndex( array, index ) *)


(* Index/Value count *)

(* Binding to pervasive function COUNT *)

PROCEDURE [COUNT] count ( array : ProtoStaticArray ) : LONGCARD;
(* Procedure to return the index/value count of a Static Array ADT value. *)

(* An expression of the form COUNT(array)
   is synthesised as ArrayADT.count(array) *)


(* Iteration *)

(* Procedure to iterate over all index/value pairs of a Static Array ADT
   value in ascending order and execute the passed in doStatements for each
   pair. *)
   
(* A statement of the form
     FOR index IN array DO statementSeq END
   is synthesised in two steps.
   The loop header is synthesised as

(* A statement of the form

(* Dyadic operations *)

(* The operations +, -, * and / are not common to all Static Array ADTs,

(* Procedure to test the equivalence of two Static Array ADT values. *)

(* An expression of the form array1 = array2

(* The operation for the # operator
   is synthesized as NOT (array1 = array2) *)


(* Binding to < operator *)

(* The operations < and <= are not meaningful for arrays. *)


(* Binding to > operator *)

(* The operations > and >= are not meaningful for arrays. *)
