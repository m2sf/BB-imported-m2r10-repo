DEFINITION MODULE BS16IO [ProtoIO] FOR BS16;

(* I/O Module for Type BS16 *)

FROM FileIO IMPORT File;

(* The EBNF for the textual representation of BS16 values is:
    bitsetValue : simpleFormat | compactFormat | bitGroupFormat ;
    simpleFormat : bit+ ;
    compactFormat : base16Digit+ ;
    bitGroupFormat : "{" bit+ ( groupSeparator? bit+ )* "}" ;
    groupSeparator : " " | "." ;
    bit  : "0" | "1" ;
    base16Digit : "0" .. "9" | "A" .. "F" ;
   The number of bits shown is equal to the bitwidth of the BS16 type. *)

PROCEDURE [READ] Read ( infile : File; VAR bitset : BS16 );
(* Reads the textual representation of a BS16 value from stream infile
   - any leading whitespace is skipped
   - any remaining characters that are part of the value being read are
     removed from infile
   - the textual representation of the value read is assigned to set
   - the file status is set to any of:
     success, outOfRange, wrongFormat, endOfLine, or endOfInput. This
   procedure is substituted for invocations of READ with a BS16 argument. *)

PROCEDURE [WRITE] ( outfile : File; CONST bitset : BS16 );
(* Writes the value of BS16 bitset in simple format to stream outfile. This
   procedure is substituted for invocations of WRITE with a BS16 argument.*)

PROCEDURE [WRITEF] WriteF
  ( outfile      : File;
    CONST fmtStr : ARRAY OF CHAR;
    items        : ARGLIST OF CONST BS16 );
(* Writes a formatted textual representation of one or more BS16 values to
   output stream outfile. The output format is determined by fmtStr. This
   procedure is substituted for invocations of WRITEF with one or more
   BS16 arguments. *)

   (* for arrays of the type *)

PROCEDURE [READ] ReadArray ( infile : File; VAR value : ARRAY OF BS16 );
(* Calls Read repeatedly to read the textual representation of a sequence of
 BS16 values from stream infile nto an array 
   - the file status is set to any of:
     success, outOfRange, wrongFormat, endOfLine, or endOfInput. This
   procedure is substituted for invocations of READ with an ARRAY OF BS16 argument.*)


PROCEDURE [WRITE] WriteArray ( outfile : File; CONST value : ARRAY OF BS16 );
(* Calls Write repeatedly to write an array  of BS16in simple format to stream outfile.
  This procedure is substituted for invocations of WRITE with an ARRAY OF BS16 argument.*)

PROCEDURE [WRITEF] WriteArrayF
  ( outfile      : File;
    CONST fmtStr : ARRAY OF CHAR;
    items        : ARGLIST OF CONST ARRAY OF BS16 );
(* Writes a formatted textual representation of one or more ARRAY OF BS16 values to
   output stream outfile. The output format is determined by fmtStr. This
   procedure is substituted for invocations of WRITEF with one or more
   ARRAY OF BS16 arguments. *)
