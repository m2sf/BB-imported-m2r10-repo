DEFINITION MODULE BcdIO [ProtoIO] FOR BCD;

(* I/O Module for Type BCD *)

FROM FileIO IMPORT File;

PROCEDURE [READ] Read( infile : File; VAR n : BCD );
(* Reads the textual representation of a BCD value from stream infile
   - any leading whitespace is skipped
   - any remaining characters that are part of the numeral being read are
     removed from infile
   - the numeric value of the numeral string read is assigned to the variable
     passed in for n
   - the file status is set to any of:
     success, outOfRange, wrongFormat, endOfLine, or endOfInput. This
   procedure is substituted for invocations of READ with a BCD argument. *)

PROCEDURE [WRITE] Write( outfile : File; CONST n : BCD );
(* Writes the textual representation of value n to stream outfile. This
   procedure is substituted for invocations of WRITE with a BCD argument.*)

PROCEDURE [WRITEF] WriteF
  ( outfile      : File;
    CONST fmtStr : ARRAY OF CHAR;
    items        : ARGLIST OF CONST BCD );
(* Writes a formatted textual representation of one or more BYTE values to
   output stream outfile. The output format is determined by fmtStr. This
   procedure is substituted for invocations of WRITEF with one or more
   BCD arguments. *)

PROCEDURE [READ] ReadArray ( infile : File; VAR value : ARRAY OF BCD );
(* Calls Read repeatedly to read the textual representation of a sequence of
 BCD values from stream infile into an array.
   - the file status is set to any of:
     success, outOfRange, wrongFormat, endOfLine, or endOfInput. This
   procedure is substituted for invocations of READ with an ARRAY OF BCD argument.*)


PROCEDURE [WRITE] WriteArray ( outfile : File; CONST value : ARRAY OF BCD );
(* Calls Write repeatedly to write an array  of BCDin simple format to stream outfile.
  This procedure is substituted for invocations of WRITE with an ARRAY OF BCD argument.*)

PROCEDURE [WRITEF] WriteArrayF
  ( outfile      : File;
    CONST fmtStr : ARRAY OF CHAR;
    items        : ARGLIST OF CONST ARRAY OF BCD );

(* Writes a formatted textual representation of one or more ARRAY OF BCD values to
   output stream outfile. The output format is determined by fmtStr. This
   procedure is substituted for invocations of WRITEF with one or more
   ARRAY OF BCD arguments. *)
