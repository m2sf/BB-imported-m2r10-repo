FROM FileIO IMPORT File;


PROCEDURE [READ] Read( infile : File; VAR n : UNISTRING );
(* Reads the textual representation of a UNISTRING value from stream infile
   - any leading whitespace is skipped
   - any remaining characters that are part of the unistring being read are
     removed from infile
   - the textual representation of the unistring read is assigned to the variable
     passed in for s
   - the file status is set to any of:
     success, outOfRange, wrongFormat, endOfLine, or endOfInput. This
   procedure is substituted for invocations of READ with a UNISTRING argument. *)

PROCEDURE [WRITE] Write( outfile : File; CONST n : UNISTRING );
(* Writes the textual representation of value n to stream outfile. This
   procedure is substituted for invocations of WRITE with a UNISTRING argument.*)

PROCEDURE [WRITEF] WriteF
  ( outfile      : File;
    CONST fmtStr : ARRAY OF CHAR;
    items        : ARGLIST OF CONST UNISTRING );
(* Writes a formatted textual representation of one or more BYTE values to
   output stream outfile. The output format is determined by fmtStr. This
   procedure is substituted for invocations of WRITEF with one or more
   UNISTRING arguments. *)

PROCEDURE [READ] ReadArray ( infile : File; VAR value : ARRAY OF UNISTRING );
(* Calls Read repeatedly to read the textual representation of a sequence of
 UNISTRING values from stream infile into an array.
   - the file status is set to any of:
     success, outOfRange, wrongFormat, endOfLine, or endOfInput. This
   procedure is substituted for invocations of READ with an ARRAY OF UNISTRING argument.*)


PROCEDURE [WRITE] WriteArray ( outfile : File; CONST value : ARRAY OF UNISTRING );
(* Calls Write repeatedly to write an array  of UNISTRINGin simple format to stream outfile.
  This procedure is substituted for invocations of WRITE with an ARRAY OF UNISTRING argument.*)

PROCEDURE [WRITEF] WriteArrayF
  ( outfile      : File;
    CONST fmtStr : ARRAY OF CHAR;
    items        : ARGLIST OF CONST ARRAY OF UNISTRING );

(* Writes a formatted textual representation of one or more ARRAY OF UNISTRING values to
   output stream outfile. The output format is determined by fmtStr. This
   procedure is substituted for invocations of WRITEF with one or more
   ARRAY OF UNISTRING arguments. *)
