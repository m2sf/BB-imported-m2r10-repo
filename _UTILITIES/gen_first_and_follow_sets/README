# Modula-2 R10 Compiler (m2r10c)
#
# Information on building the First- and Follow-Set Generator utility.

GUIDE

To build the utility, several files need to be copied from the source
directory of the reference compiler to this directory.  Subsequently
the utility can be built by invoking 'make'.

The resulting executable will output the First- and Follow-Set.

CURRENT FILES

The following files should already exist in this directory:

gen_first_and_follow_sets.c
m2_tokenset_literals.c
m2_tokenset_literals.h
Makefile

EXTRA FILES 

The following files should be copied from the source directory
of the reference compiler:

alloc.h
ASCII.h
common.h
m2_build_params.h
m2_first_follow.h
m2_productions.c
m2_productions.h
m2_table_of_productions.h
m2_table_of_reserved_words.h
