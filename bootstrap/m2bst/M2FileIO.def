PROCEDURE openInfile
  ( VAR file : M2File; name : Filename; VAR status : Status );
(* Passes back a newly allocated instance of M2File, associated with source
   file name.  The file is opened for reading and the status of the operation
   is passed back in status.  Passes NIL in file if unsuccessful. *)


PROCEDURE openOutfile
  ( VAR file : M2File; name : Filename; VAR status : Status );
(* Passes back a newly allocated instance of M2File, associated with source
   file name.  The file is opened for writing and the status of the operation
   is passed back in status.  Passes NIL in file if unsuccessful. *)


PROCEDURE read ( file : M2File; VAR ch : CHAR );
(* Reads the current 7-bit ASCII character from file, passes it back in ch and
   advances the file's internal reading position accordingly.  If a character
   with a code point >= 127 is found, ASCII.DEL is passed back instead.  If an
   end-of-line marker is found, the first character following the end-of-line
   marker is passed back, and the internal reading position and line and
   column counters are updated accordingly.  If the end-of-file has been
   reached prior to the call, ASCII.NUL is passed back. *)


PROCEDURE lookahead ( file : M2File; VAR ch : CHAR );
(* Reads the current lookahead character from file and passes it back in ch
   without advancing the file's internal reading position and without up-
   dating the line and column counters. *)


PROCEDURE lookahead2 ( file : M2File; VAR ch : CHAR );
(* Reads the second lookahead character from file and passes it back in ch
   without advancing the file's internal reading position and without up-
   dating the line and column counters. *)


PROCEDURE write ( file : M2File; ch : CHAR );
(* Writes 7-bit ASCII character ch to file. *)

PROCEDURE writeStr ( file : M2File; s : ARRAY OF CHAR );
(* Writes character string s to file. *)

PROCEDURE sync ( file : M2File );
(* Writes the internal buffer of file to the file. *)

PROCEDURE getStatus ( file : M2File; VAR status : Status );
(* Passes the status of file's last operation back in status. *)

PROCEDURE getPos ( file : M2File; VAR line, col : CARDINAL );
(* Passes the current line and column counter of file back in line and col. *)

PROCEDURE eof ( file : M2File ) : BOOLEAN;
(* Returns TRUE if the end of file has been reached, otherwise FALSE. *)

PROCEDURE close ( file : M2File; VAR status : Status );
(* Closes file and passes the status of the operation back in status. *)
