(* Reads the textual representation of a BOOLEAN value from stream infile
   - any leading whitespace is skipped
   - any remaining characters that are part of the value being read are
     removed from infile
   - the textual representation of the value read is assigned to b
   - the file status is set to any of:
     success, outOfRange, wrongFormat, endOfLine, or endOfInput. This
   function is substituted for invocations of READ with a BOOLEAN argument. *)

(* Writes a formatted textual representation of one or more BOOLEAN values to
   output stream outfile. The value of parameter items is calculated and
   inserted automatically. The output format is determined by fmtStr.
   This function is substituted for invocations of WRITEF with one or more
   BOOLEAN arguments. *)
